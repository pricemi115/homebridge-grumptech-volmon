## [1.2.1] - 2021-10-25 (Autumn Release ðŸŽƒðŸŽƒ)
Happy Halloween!! Apparently, prior versions did indeed contain a trick!! Sorry about that.
### Fixed
- [Issue #31](https://github.com/pricemi115/homebridge-grumptech-volmon/issues/31): Graceful handling of unsupported operating systems. Previously, installation on an unsupported operating system would result in homebridge rebooting indefinitely. Appologies to any who were affected by this issue.

## [1.2.0] - 2021-10-21 (Autumn Release ðŸŽƒ)
Happy Halloween!! This update is "all treat", no tricks.
### What's new
- [Issue #23](https://github.com/pricemi115/homebridge-grumptech-volmon/issues/23): Added support for remote volumes mounted via SMB
- Previously, the plug in would only recognize volumes in `/Volumes`. Now all mounted volumes are detected and the user can specify a regular expression mask to exclude volumes from detection. Common masks are set by default to exclude Time Machine APFS volumes and other "internal" volumes that are present on current versions of masOS.

### Fixed
- Updated all dependencies.

- [Issue #16](https://github.com/pricemi115/homebridge-grumptech-volmon/issues/16): Added support to automatically remove offline/non-visible volumes. Set the `Purge` switch to on.
